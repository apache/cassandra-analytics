/**
 * A rid is just a pair of ids that uniquely identifies the row and the column of a data entity.
 * Reading a Cassandra SSTable pivots the data in a way that projects all columns against the rows
 * they belong to:
 * <p>
 * Cassandra:
 * r1 | c1, c2, c3
 * r2 | c4
 * r3 | c5, c6, c7, c8
 * <p>
 * Pivoted:
 * r1 | c1
 * r1 | c2
 * r1 | c3
 * r2 | c4
 * r3 | c5
 * r3 | c6
 * r3 | c7
 * r3 | c8
 * <p>
 * During a loading operation we will extract up to a few trillion items out of SSTables, so it is of
 * high importance to reuse objects - the caller to the scanner creates a rid using the
 * callers implementation of those interfaces; the scanner then calls set**Copy() to provide the data
 * at which point the implementation should make a copy of the provided bytes.
 * <p>
 * Upon return from the next() call the current values of the scanner can be obtained by calling
 * the methods in Rid, getPartitionKey(), getColumnName(), getValue().
 *
 * @param <Type> type of object returned by rid() method.
