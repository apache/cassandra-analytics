/**
 * The facade interface defines the contract of the extension for cloud storage data transport.
 * It servers as the integration point for the library consumer.
 * - Register callbacks for data transport progress
 * - Supply necessary information, e.g. credentials, bucket, etc., to conduct a successful data transport
 * <br>
 * Notes for the interface implementors:
 * -  Not all methods defined in the interface are invoked in both Spark driver and executors.
 *    1. The methods in {@link CommonStorageTransportExtension} are invoked in both places.
 *    2. The methods in {@link ExecutorStorageTransportExtension} are invoked in Spark executors only.
 *    3. The methods in {@link DriverStorageTransportExtension} are invoked in Spark driver only.
 * -  The Analytics library guarantees the following sequence in Spark driver on initialization
 *    1. Create the new {@link StorageTransportExtension} instance
 *    2. Invoke {@link #initialize(String, SparkConf, boolean)}
 *    3. Invoke {@link #getStorageConfiguration()}
 *    4. Invoke {@link #setCredentialChangeListener(CredentialChangeListener)}
 *    5. Invoke {@link #setObjectFailureListener(ObjectFailureListener)}
